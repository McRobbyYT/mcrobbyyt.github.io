    <h1>Why there's strict verification</h1>
<p>Due to the overwhelming rise of Large Language Models, maintaining a website has never been harder.</p>

<p>What was once a space for sharing ideas freely has become a battleground against relentless scraping bots, tirelessly indexing and repackaging content without consent.</p>

<p>Since scrapers will not stop, I decided to implement strict verification to stop the scrapers from accessing other links.</p>

<p>It’s not something I take lightly, but after seeing my work show up in places it shouldn't — often without credit — I felt I had no choice but to take action.</p>

<p>I do apologize for the inconvenience, especially to those fond of my work.</p>

<p>I understand this may disrupt your experience, and I truly appreciate your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>These measures are simply here to preserve the integrity of the content and to ensure that it reaches real people — not just machines.</p>
