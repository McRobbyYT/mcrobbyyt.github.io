    <h1>Why there's strict verification</h1>
<p>
Because AI bots are everywhere now, running a website is way harder than it used to be.<br>
What used to be a place to share stuff has turned into a fight with bots that keep stealing and reusing my work without asking.<br><br>
Since these bots won’t quit, I added strict verification so they can’t get to other pages.<br>
I don’t love doing this, but after seeing my work pop up in random places without credit, I felt I had to.<br><br>
Sorry if this is annoying.
